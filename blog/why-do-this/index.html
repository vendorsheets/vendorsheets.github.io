If you’ve made it here, chances are you’ve gone through the same battle we have… lengthy vendor authorization forms, confusing jargon, brokers that promise you the world, etc, etc. We feel your pain and are setting out to grow with you on your path to building a successful business in this world of retail.</p>
<p>As some quick background on myself, I started a natural food company with a friend of mine as a freshman in college. Knowing nothing about the retail space, I thought, “How hard could it be?”, but little did I know, this industry (like many others) is filled with archaic processes, strange customs that are not friendly to small food companies, and above all else, antiquated vendor authorization forms that quickly became the bane of my existence. These forms would take me days to complete and half the time, I messed up something in it and would have to do it all over again. Google quickly became a great friend of mine, as I would constantly be trying to define the latest acronym.</p>
<p>After enduring this process of vendor form after vendor form while getting our products in thousands of retail locations, I knew something needed to be done. I went to some of my smart developer friends for help, walked them through my problems, and (after some much needed venting) they built me a simple tool that automated vendor forms for me. From this experience with helping me solve my problem, we decided to start Vendorsheets to get rid of the antiquated processes we all tolerate, educate all sides of the retail industry, and make the journey of an emerging brand easier. </p>
<p>Our solution offers a single form that will walk you through the process, cut through the jargon, and give you the completed forms of any retailer you need at the click of a button. Want to be one of the first to try it? Sign up below and we’ll be in touch soon. In the meantime, stick around, check out our blog on tips/tricks from other entrepreneurs, and we look forward to being a part of your journey.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/blog/why-do-this/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-66904f1fe75d6bf240ab.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-post-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-5fbb152f300bc88a35c1.js"],"component---src-pages-blog-js":["/component---src-pages-blog-js-92fead6b50513695b8f8.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-07e8ceb3031fb5079621.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-5fbb152f300bc88a35c1.js" async=""></script><script src="/commons-a539020152510ffcef9a.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-66904f1fe75d6bf240ab.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-eb6350540ec12af0a656.js" async=""></script></body></html>
