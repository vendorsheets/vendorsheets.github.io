If you’ve made it here, chances are you’ve gone through the same battles many have before you… lengthy vendor authorization forms, confusing jargon, brokers that promise you the world, etc, etc. We know the struggle and are setting out to grow with you on your path to building a successful business in this world of CPG.</p>\n<p>As some quick background on what got us here, a friend of mine started a natural food company in college. Knowing nothing about the retail space, he thought, “How hard could it be?”, but little did he know, the food industry (like many others) is filled with archaic processes, strange customs that are not friendly to small food companies, and above all else, antiquated vendor authorization forms that quickly became the bane of his existence. These forms would take him days to complete and half the time, he messed up something in it and would have to do it all over again. “Google quickly became a great friend of mine, as I would constantly be trying to define the latest acronym”, he would vent to me. </p>\n<p>After enduring this process of vendor form after vendor form while getting his products in thousands of retailers, he asked if I could help. As a developer, I love solving problems and building out processes, so I agreed to build him a tool to automate this form filling process. After a couple weekends, we had something that worked! Problem solved! But looking back at his journey, the problem was far beyond just the vendor authorization forms he hated filling out, which is why I decided to start vendorsheets. To get rid of the antiquated processes emerging brands tolerate, educate all sides of the retail industry, and make the CPG journey easier. </p>\n<p>Our solution offers a single form that will walk you through the process, cut through the jargon, and give you the completed forms of any retailer you need at the click of a button.
