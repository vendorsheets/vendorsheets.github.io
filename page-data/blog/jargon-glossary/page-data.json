There’s a ton of these jargon-heavy terms so feel free to click on the one you’re looking for below to be taken to the definition. If you’re looking for the full rundown, go grab yourself some non-GMO popcorn and get ready to scroll:</p>\n<h4>UPC:</h4>\n<p>Universal Product Code, which is just the barcode on your products. There are multiple types of barcodes for various packaging configurations and uses, but the UPC is the basic 12-digit code that scans at the retailers and is most widely used/needed in retail. </p>\n<p>Do you need one? Check out the GS1 web application to get your very own codes! We also have another blog post [Link to UPC blog post] you can check out with a basic overview outlining how to apply and what to keep in mind.</p>\n<h4>TPR:</h4>\n<p>Temporary Price Reduction. This is how you run promotions for your products and reduce the price for customers at retail (i.e. buy 2 for $5). To execute a TPR, there may be a fee associated with it depending on the retailer, but there are two other pieces of jargon that go along with it; OI’s and MCB’s.</p>\n<h4>OI:</h4>\n<p>Off-Invoice - this is a discount taken off the top of your order from the distributor. It helps them run promotions to bring on new retailers to carry your product.\nMCB: Manufacturer Chargeback - this is a discount taken after your product is at the retailer and the individual retailer will charge you back for the promotion you’re running. </p>\n<h4>ACV:</h4>\n<p>This stands for All Commodity Volume. What that means is the percent of the market that is carrying a specific item. As you begin to approach larger chains, they might ask what your ACV is. </p>\n<h4>Billback:</h4>\n<p>This is similar to the MCB mentioned above where it takes place after an order has been placed. It’s basically a charge to you (the supplier) based on a quantity of cases shipped by a distributor or retailer.</p>\n<h4>BOGO:</h4>\n<p>Just like your favorite shoe sale at DSW… this stands for buy one, get one. This is a promotion that is typically placed with opening orders for retailers to help get on shelf. This can also be extended to sales at the store level for consumers.</p>\n<h4>Case Stack Deal:</h4>\n<p>This is one of my favorite promotions to run with stores - it’s a promotional discount you give to stores if they buy a certain amount of cases of a given item. It also typically comes with great placement in the store (i.e. an end cap, a standup display in the aisles, etc.)</p>\n<h4>COGS:</h4>\n<p>This is more of a business term and less something you’d find on a vendor approval form, but in case you come across it, it stands for Cost of Goods Sold.</p>\n<h4>Coupon Handling:</h4>\n<p>When you want to start offering coupons to help promote in-store sales, you’ll need to work with a clearinghouse to get them made. Coupon handling is a charge incurred by you for making the coupon - it’s typically about $0.08/coupon. </p>\n<h4>CPG:</h4>\n<p>People will say CPG when they’re referring to your products or the industry. It stands for Consumer packaged goods. </p>\n<h4>EDLP:</h4>\n<p>This stands for EveryDay Low Price. Some retailers won’t discount products, but instead want to set one low price that will always remain the price. You’ll typically need to offer a lower price to them to help meet the EDLP that would be offered.  </p>\n<h4>EDV:</h4>\n<p>This stands for EveryDay Value - refer to EDLP (same thing, different acronym. Queue eye-roll) </p>\n<h4>FDM:</h4>\n<p>This stands for Food/Drug/Mass, which are channels of trade. Food (i.e. grocery stores), Drug (i.e. CVS, Walgreens, etc.), Mass (i.e. Walmart, Target, etc.)</p>\n<h4>FOB:</h4>\n<p>Freight on Board, which is the price paid by a distributor when they pick-up product at the manufacturer’s warehouse</p>\n<h4>Free Fill:</h4>\n<p>Product sold to retailer at \"no charge\" in order to gain distribution at said account. Usually, you’ll want to try to pair this with some sort of intro promotion so you can get customers to try your products, the retailer moves through the inventory, and you get a (paid!) re-order.</p>\n<h4>FSI:</h4>\n<p>Free Standing Insert, refers to a Manufacturer's Coupon that is placed in a newspaper or magazine</p>\n<h4>HBC:</h4>\n<p>Health and Beauty Care. For some reason, nutrition bars are placed in this section of the store at times, but usually cosmetics, band-aids, etc.</p>\n<h4>Hip Pocket Deal:</h4>\n<p>Deal given to a retail rep or broker that is only for select accounts that might need a little extra nudge to bring you in. </p>\n<h4>Intro Deal:</h4>\n<p>As it sounds, this is a deal given to a distributor when a product is first authorized to help get some movement. Similar to the Free Fill mentioned above. </p>\n<h4>IRC:</h4>\n<p>This stands for Instant Redeemable Coupon, which is a coupon that is on the package which is for immediate use in the store. Popular with beverages or larger products that can fit it/makes sense to place the physical coupons all on there. For other smaller items (i.e. candy, bars, etc.), you can put coupons on a tear pad to place it on a display or shelf.</p>\n<h4>IRI:</h4>\n<p>Information Resources Inc, Company that collects sales data and sells reports to manufacturers. These can be expensive but helpful as you scale to understand what you’re doing right, where you can improve, and compile sales data for fundraising materials.</p>\n<h4>Landed Cost:</h4>\n<p>Distributor Cost for a distributor that picks up product, that includes freight charges as an all-in cost</p>\n<h4>Lead Time:</h4>\n<p>Time in days that a manufacturer needs to deliver a PO to a distributor. The less your lead time the better, but make sure you can live up to it.</p>\n<h4>P&#x26;L:</h4>\n<p>This is a financial statement showing your profits and losses over a stretch of time. </p>\n<h4>POG:</h4>\n<p>Plan-O-Gram, the layout of products in a section of a store. You’ll hear this brought up by buyers as they are planning their category reviews.</p>\n<h4>Scan Down (A.K.A. Scans):</h4>\n<p>Promotion given to retail where manufacturer pays for product \"scanned\" during a specific period. Similar to TPRs mentioned in the beginning. </p>\n<h4>SKU:</h4>\n<p>Stock Keeping Unit, refers to an individual item in your product line. Usually just a flavor in a range of products. </p>\n<h4>Slotting:</h4>\n<p>A flat fee paid to distributor or retailer for them to stock a given item. This is meant to help offset the costs of removing an old item and stocking your item in each store. </p>\n<h4>SPIFS:</h4>\n<p>Reward (usually money) paid to a representative for selling a manufacturer's product. If you’re working on a specific promotion or have a display you want implemented, it helps to incentivize your sales force. </p>\n<h4>SPINS:</h4>\n<p>Company that collects sales data (specifically Natural channel) and sells reports to manufacturers</p>\n<h4>Spoilage:</h4>\n<p>Product that is unable to be sold whether through expired code date, damage etc. You’ll see this in chargeback reports from your distributors. </p>\n<h4>Velocity:</h4>\n<p>Units sold per SKU per location per week. This is the main thing you should be focused on to ensure a sustainable, successful retail business. Number of locations doesn’t matter if you have low velocity. </p>\n<h4>SRP:</h4>\n<p>Suggested retail price. This is what you want your product to be listed at when sold to an end consumer.</p>\n<h4>Ti-Hi:</h4>\n<p>The dimensions of your pallets. Ti stands for Tier (number of cases on a layer) and Hi stands for height (number of layers on a pallet). </p>\n<h4>Unsaleables:</h4>\n<p>Product that is unable to be sold whether through expired code date, damage, etc. Similar to spoilage. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/1wme5nyCjl8wWkBsFY/giphy.gif\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n<p>And that’s all I have for now!
